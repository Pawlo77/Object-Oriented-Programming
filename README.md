# Object Programming

Object Programming - part of Data Science Studies, 2nd semester, Warsaw University of Technology

The entire class is coded in **Java**, and here are some implementations of basic problems. Each folder contains a project that serves as a solution to a task specified in Polish in the .pdf file inside that folder.

In this course, we learn:
- Basic Java functions
- The concept of object programming in Java, including class inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes
- Working with collections, including implementing Comparable interfaces and creating hash functions for custom objects
- File and stream handling
- Basic GUI (Graphical User Interface)

This project allows us to acquire knowledge and practical experience in object programming in Java. It enables us to apply these skills to solve various problems.
